      <h1>My Story - From Prisoner to Programmer</h1>
      <p>When I was charged with murder as a teenager, there's no way I believed I could become a computer programmer.</p>
      <p>
        At the age of 18, fresh out of high school and with dreams of serving in
        the New Zealand Navy, I found myself at a crossroads. One fateful night, fueled by
        youthful indiscretion and the influence of alcohol, I made a decision
        that would forever alter the course of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was walking home with a friend from a party and got into an argument
        with a group of men. I was punched by one of the men in the group. I ran
        home, got a knife, and went back up the road. I saw the person who had
        punched me, and I stabbed him. He died in an ambulance on the way to the
        hospital that night.
      </p>

      <h2>A moment of anger changed my life forever</h2>
      <p>
        The weight of that event hung heavy on my shoulders as I navigated the
        legal proceedings and ultimately found myself sentenced to serve time in
        prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of my prison sentence, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery.
        Behind the prison's walls, I confronted the events of my past, grappled
        with the impact of my crime, and began the arduous process of
        rehabilitation.
      </p>
      <p>It was hard to acknowledge the harm I'd caused my
        victim, his family, my family, and my community.
      </p>
    </p>

    <h2>For a long time, I was in denial</h2>
    <p>
      In prison, I was fortunate to receive professional counselling and
      therapy. Accessing this support helped me understand the thoughts,
      feelings, and beliefs that led to my offending. I learned how to
      challenge my unhelpful thinking and beliefs that had their origins in my
      childhood traumas.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, I also found solace in education, earning two diplomas
      with top honours from Massey University, and discovered a passion for
      mentorship and personal development.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2021, after eleven years of incarceration, I was granted parole. The
      Parole Board, chaired by Sir Ron Young, recognised my strides in my
      rehabilitation journey and acknowledged my commitment to transformation
      and personal growth. It was a pivotal moment for me, and I'm grateful
      every day that I can live as a contributing member of society again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I wear multiple hats, representing my passion for well-being,
      mentorship, and personal development. As an Education Mentor at Massey
      University, I am privileged to support and guide Māori business students
      on their academic and career journeys. I cherish this role deeply, as it
      allows me to foster growth, resilience, and cultural pride among
      tomorrow's leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before my current role, I was a Production Supervisor at Taylor Preston
      Ltd, leading a team of thirty dedicated individuals in the freezers
      department. Through strategic leadership and a focus on continuous
      improvement, I implemented initiatives that enhanced efficiency,
      quality, and safety standards in my department.
    </p>

    <h2>Change is possible</h2>
    <p>My commitment to learning and growth extends beyond the classroom.</p>
    <p>
      With a Bachelor of Business in Management and Psychology from Massey
      University, I leverage my skills to drive positive change in my
      community. I'm also learning Te Reo and giving youth development
      seminars to the New Zealand Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue on my education and self-improvement journey with Take2, I hope to inspire
      change, challenge perceptions, and contribute to a more compassionate
      and inclusive society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for joining me on this journey of possibility and purpose.
